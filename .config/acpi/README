Example file to bind an ACPI event to a simple action.

In my case up and down volume buttons are recognized and have a 
keycode/sym but mute don't have. However the ACPI event when using 
the key is correctly catched (button/mute).

We use acpid daemon to bind the appropriate action

Copy this file to `/etc/acpi/events`.
